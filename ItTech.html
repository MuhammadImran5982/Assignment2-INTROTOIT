									<h2>Cyber Security</h2>
									<p>Cybersecurity is a digital way of defending systems, networks, and programmes against cyberattacks. Malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle assaults, and other types of cyber-attacks are among them. It assists in keeping these systems secure and contained, preventing any digital attacks or intrusion of these systems. Maintaining data integrity and preventing cyber threats or attacks is critical for vital systems utilised by the government, military, huge corporations, or corporate firms.
									</p>
									<p>Every day, new ways to hack or attack systems emerge as technology advances, emphasising the significance of cybersecurity. As a result, cybersecurity has been able to strengthen and get more robust and safe protection. Firms all around the world have turned to human-centric cybersecurity because of the steady increase in cyber-attacks. This type of cybersecurity allows humans to safeguard their systems more effectively than machines or programmes. Humans can obtain a better understanding of how users interact with data and the potential hazards that result from these interactions by having a bigger percentage of participation and influence over the security of these systems. The users and creators are both humans. People can approach situations with a greater comprehension and knowledge of these potential cyber-attacks and threats because they are the users and producers of our technologies and systems. The most well-known applications of cybersecurity today are the prevention of viruses in our computer systems and the protection of our online accounts from hackers using weak passwords. Many new measures have been developed to prevent potential hackers from hacking these accounts, such as basic two-factor authentication or even more difficult passwords containing symbols, digits, and different case letters. For the next few years, chief security scientists predict that ransomware will grow in quantity and execute more attacks. Because ransomware evolves at the same rate as today's technology, assaults and threats will become more difficult to identify and resist. Ransomware attacks are particularly critical to eliminate because they affect a wide range of user groups, including businesses, governments, hospitals, and others. The utilisation of quantum technology and how it affects the encryption methods we use is a new and emerging development for assisting in the protection of any type of system.

									<p>There is a huge variety of technologies and software available for use for the average person which provide protection for endpoint devices such as computers, mobiles, routers, networks, and the cloud. As these all may be present in any individual’s life, there are many technologies and software’s to choose to provide protection from unwanted external users. Common technology used for these purposes include next-generation firewalls, DNS filtering, antivirus software’s, Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics, Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN), malware protection just to name a few. Context-Aware Behavioural Analytics is a common form of cybersecurity mainly for larger organisations. It uses sophisticated behavioural analytics to supervise and identify any apprehensive interactions and transactions towards their data and systems. This type of security is more efficient than static infrastructure security such as firewalls and antivirus software which do not possess the highly advanced and sensitive data of the world of technology today. Another standard form of cybersecurity is Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN) which is mainly utilised to counterattack MIM (man-in-the-middle) attacks. This allows this method to actively seek the attacker who is essentially breaking through the systems from internally to the outside, interrupting the communication between the sender and receiver and its pathway. VDN are highly valued in large companies or government settings due to its ability to maintain data integrity as they are associated with commercial industries with high-value targets such as banks and utilities. Therefore, they are replacing Virtual Private Networks (VPN’s) as VDN’s provide greater security and infrastructure allowing smoother management and thereby performance. 
										A lack of cybersecurity can be a major risk for a company and its database systems. Without cybersecurity, companies could potentially experience a cyberattack and may be left with a large cost to repair the damage that was caused on the systems. Therefore, cybersecurity has been able to play a major role in being beneficial to many businesses’ economical costs. A company’s reputation could potentially be damaged or negatively influenced due to their lack of cybersecurity and therefore costing their company’s image. This could’ve been prevented with the presence of a strong data protection software such as a Data loss prevention (DLP) software tool. This may cause loss of trust between the company and consumers as well as potential future customers. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organisations may suffer from regulatory fines due to any potential cyber-threats. The GDPR is a law which ensures specifically for the European Union that data protection is established in organisations to protect their personal information and any sensitive data within their systems. 
										</p>
									<p>The importance of cybersecurity for companies and in individual’s lives is constantly increasing overtime due to technology evolving every day. Cyber-attacks are more harmful than ever and most likely never stop. This will cause an increase in demand for jobs associated with cybersecurity for both small and larger companies. As more businesses turn digital and rely on computer systems to store their essential data, the need for data protection has raised in priority, therefore providing more job opportunities in the cybersecurity field. Due to covid-19, more companies and individuals have switched to operate remotely, therefore involving more cyber experts who could prevent malicious attacks and detect any potential data breaches soon. 
									</p>
									<p>As technology becomes increasingly advanced overtime, those without the required expertise and skills in cybersecurity are more vulnerable to cyberthreats and attacks. These may occur simply in our own homes and could affect how we use technology in our daily lives. Many individuals and families may even be unaware of the possibility of a cyberattack, therefore being at a higher risk than organisations who possess a cybersecurity system. There are individuals or employees who lack the knowledge of cyber-attacks or threats and could potentially provide a gateway for a hacker to gain access to their organisations data systems and information unintentionally through an infected attachment or to a phishing scam. 
									</p>
									<p>Many common mistakes that individuals make that could lead to possible cyber- attacks are due to their weak passwords or pins. This could increase the vulnerability to the individuals accounts such as emails, social media accounts, banking sites and many more. This also applies to passwords to gain access to their electronic devices such as mobiles phones, computers, or laptops. Passwords require a lot of complexity with the use of numbers and symbols to ensure greater security. Simple requirements like these may save your personal or company’s information from being lost or loss of access.</p>
									<p>In this highly digitally based time, nearly every piece of technology in which we possess is connected to a source of internet and WIFI. This includes phones, computers, tablets and even refrigerators in which all could be potentially hacked and experience a data breach due to a lack of cybersecurity. Devices that are connected to any source of WIFI or internet are more vulnerable to being hijacked as many hackers can gain access to these WI-FI connections and therefore all the devices that are connected to it. However, this can be avoided through many preventative measures which can be performed such as installing refutable security and anti-virus software, changing passwords on a regular basis, and remaining aware of email attachments to prevent any phishing scams.

										<h2>Machine Learning:</h2>
										<P>At a basic level, machine learning is the process of feeding computers and machines data and information with the intention of having the systems be able to make predictions and understand the meaning behind that data. This process can have many various applications, such as understanding the meaning of homonyms in a sentence or identifying what something is in an image. While previously humans may have written code to allow for a program to understand these things, through the application of machine learning, data being fed into these systems is what allows them to distinguish meaning behind the information that is given to them. This can be completed in generally one of two ways: supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.</P>
										<P>Supervised learning is the process of having a data set with each piece of data labelled with the correct answer to what it is. One primary way of substantiating the use of supervised learning is using digit recognition, which will have handwritten digits with the number that is being shown labelled, so the machine is able to scan the handwritten digits and understand what it is meant to be displaying. This experiment is often undertaken with the MNIST dataset, which includes over 60,000 training images of the digits 0 through 9, and 10,000 images for testing the program. While this example only provides a machine the ability to determine numerical digits, the scope of different data sets can be expanded upon to include alphanumeric digits and symbols, as well as using image recognition of other things such as fruits.</P>
										<P>Where supervised learning gives definite answers to a data set, unsupervised learning allows for the machine to learn and create its understanding of the data set given to it itself without any preconceived notions of what is what within the given set. Generally speaking, unsupervised training will either work in one of two ways: by association and by clustering. By association means that the computer system will recognise that one piece of data will commonly be followed or linked to another piece of data (such as a user on amazon that buys a book may also buy a bookmark) thus allowing the system to understand and predict that pairing of information in the future. By clustering, the system will understand specific traits about the data and organise them into groups together to create pockets of data that will commonly have the similar traits shared among all pieces of data within that group.</P>
										<P>At this point in time, machine learning is being used in many ways. Some good examples include Netflix’s recommendation algorithm, that takes shows you have previously watched and enjoyed with data from similar users and thus recommends shows for a user to watch. Furthermore, the algorithm gives each show a percent match on how well the algorithm believes you will enjoy the show. While recommendation algorithms such as Netflix’s are quite common among different websites, other applications of machine learning include digital assistants, such as Siri, who rely on speech recognition to understand a user’s wants and needs through the service, creating expert systems to play games such as google's AlphaGo system, as well as having more practical application within medicine predicting potential diseases a patient may have or finding tumours in x-rays.
										</P>
										<P>While a large amount of uses for machine learning are generally beneficial to the general populace, as the technology advances and becomes better at recognising different pieces of information in data sets the inevitable application of this technology into security and surveillance is soon approaching. One notable application for machine learning within mass surveillance is China’s use of facial recognition, in which China alleges that Sky Net, their facial recognition system, “can scan China’s population of about 1.4 billion people in a second”.  While this claim may not be true, the growing invasion of privacy with mass surveillance will only further be perpetuated with the advancement of machine learning.
										</P>
										<P>With the integration of machine learning into society the general impact is making life easier for the average person. Whether this ease comes in the form of better and more personalised recommendations for shows to watch or what items to buy, or in the form of better speech recognition within digital assistants, the ease of using different forms of technology imbued with machine learning will become vastly more efficient and easier to use.
										</P>
										<P>Additionally, the implementation of machine learning into more practical fields, such as education and medicine, will streamline these processes.
										</P>
										<P>With its inclusion into the education system, programs will be able create plans to help struggling students with their learning, as well as reaching into a backlog of information on how to best deliver the teaching depending on the individual and how they best learn. This can reduce the load for both teachers and students, allowing for a better learning experience to be crafted within their learning environment.
										</P>
										<P>Similarly, the inclusion of machine learning within healthcare has begun and will continue to be able to help identify tumours within radiology scans as well as detecting cancers more accurately than could previously be done. Furthermore, machine learning is expected to eventually be able to diagnose patients more accurately with different illnesses and diseases based on a range of factors specific to the person rather than just the general symptoms that are being presented.
										</P>
										<P>As I had mentioned before, the increase in complexity lends its hand in being used in mass surveillance systems such as China’s ‘Sky Net’. While this may seem dystopian in nature, the addition of facial recognition into security systems will allow for greater ease in catching criminals and punishing people who choose to break the law. Furthermore, machine learning and predictive algorithms that may be made from the data analysed by such systems may be able to predict major crime areas and times thus allowing for greater resources to be funnelled into those areas for preventative measures to be enacted.
										</P>
										<P>Primarily, the effects of machine learning would mostly go unnoticed on a surface level. With most systems that take advantage of machine learning being things that work behind the scenes of the technological landscape that we live in, the optimisations of things such as speech recognition and predictive algorithms that come from using machine learning will continue to increase in great strides. These improvements will further guide us to living more efficient lives and increase the ease of using technology within the future.
										</P>
										<P>Furthermore, with machine learning being increasingly used in the medical field things such as gaining diagnoses would be greatly increased. Had this technology been 10 to 15 years more advanced than it currently is, I may have had a machine analyse the symptoms I was showing for my auto-immune disease, which is quite rare, and thus not having to go through a difficult 18-month long process to come to a diagnosis. For machine learning to reduce waiting times for diagnoses, but to also factor in the slight difference in symptoms between each person, this could greatly reduce the severity and advancement of many diseases on people like myself.
										</P>
										<P>Ultimately, the effects of machine learning within mine and the average person’s life will greatly improve basic day to day activities, but also has the potential to drastically change lives, whether that be for good through its application within education and medicine, or bad through its use in mass surveillance and security

											<h2>Robotics:</h2>
											<h4>Summary</h4>
											<P>Robot, or “robota” coming from the Czech language, is a relatively new technology designed for the autonomous use of manufacturing products for industrial consumers at this current time. Current day robots are comprised of primarily human elements, primary arms. However, when depicted in pictures or drawings, it mostly shows human or animal automated machines.
											</P>
											<h4>What do they Do?</h4>
											<P>The top uses for the application of robots are Space Exploration, Entertainment, Agriculture and Health care. However, these uses all use a human element to control the robot. These robots are made in these industries to help with complex procedures that need precision, such as health care.</P>
											<P>Health care robots are used in the medical industry to operate on a person who has complicated procedures that need small increments to move in. The best example of a medical robot is the "DaVinci" robot. The robot can be seen in videos peeling the skin of a grape and sowing it back on, as this is not exactly what the robot will do in real life; however, just a demonstration of its preciseness and accuracy when working with small increments.</P>
											<P>
												Space Exploration robots are used mainly by NASA, examples being the rovers sent to Mars. The space exploration rovers are used with the intent of them being able to navigate around unfamiliar terrain to earth and being used with more than 15 minutes of latency between commands of a human operator. There has been a total of 4 sent to Mars, and one has a drone that was able to fly using mars' atmosphere.											</P>
											<P>The most well-known robot industry is called Boston dynamics. Their website states they're focusing "on creating robots with advance mobility, dexterity and intelligence". As seen in their videos and public and private demonstrations, the robotic creatures can be able to move and grab things like humans or animals. Boston dynamics is also extensively known for its unique mechanical movement seen in multiple videos. In one video, they demonstrate the robots dancing to "do you love me". These robots move with a fixed leg, not with a wheel, allowing them to be more able to move in environments that are more unforgiving than a wheel- based robot due to inclination and ground integrity. Boston Dynamics' State of the art robot is called the atlas; according to their website, it's the "Most Dynamic Human Robot" and is the first to use knowledgeable AI to
												move around. Funny enough, the robot weighs 89kg and can run up to speeds of 2.5m/s and have whole-body coordination and dynamic motion. It achieves this by using real-time depth perception to accurately predict where and how it will stand on specific services and balance whilst doing so due to its intelligent AI system.
											</P>
											<P>Robots have been in the world for an extended time; however, they are more predominantly showing up now since they work in production lines or high-intensity production industries. In the future, however, Robots are looking to be the powerhouse of production as they are being used more in factories; to easy to say that in 3 years, robots will be taking over these industries and making products more readily available.

											<h4>What will Change?</h4>
											<P>With the rapid advancement in technology with robots, there is no saying what the distant future may bring them into the world. However, shortly, we have a strong standing on where it might be. According to Robert d. In his article about robotics and the future of Production and work, Atkinson states that the increase of robots will allow for increased productivity and the potential to bring more manufacturing production work back to developed countries. He furthers his article to explain how there will be a “need for faster productivity” (Atkinson, 2022). The use of humans undoubtedly costs a lot of money from wages and other things such as overtime. Robots are a cheap alternative to that problem, and cheaper labour means more affordable products. As such, robots will most likely dominate the market in the future and cut people out from most of their jobs, as a fixed price robot can replace them. Since 2000 over 22 years now, there has been a total of “1.7 million jobs lost to robots” (Rise of the machines will displace 20 million workers, warns the report, 2022). According to Forbes by Jack Kelly article, the WEF “cites that automation will supplant about 85 million jobs by 2025” (Kelly, 2022). Unfortunately, with the rapid improvements in technology and AI with robotics, many people may lose their Jobs where a robot can do the same for cheaper. So, in the near future, it looks to be a fortunate one for robotics and the possibility to be more on the market for manufacturers as well as industries with large Production; however, unfortunate for people who also work in those industries as the majority of them have the significant possibility of losing their jobs. Thus, making those jobs more redundant is a problem in third-world countries because some people may not have the education to go to a better pathway for a position such as a university. Going into labour jobs such as these production jobs can cause risks and problems for people.
											</P>
											<h4>How will this effect everyday person</h4>
											<P>Excluding people working in production lines or large factories, the change to the everyday person will be
												significant. With the large replacement with the worker to machine, prices will drop, so your favourite product
												will be more readily available for a lower price. In addition, your products will arrive more frequently as the
												changes in workers within factories allow for the easiness of transportation of shelf products to deliver
												trucks/vans.
											</P>
											<P>Amazon is an excellent example of this change from human to machine, as most of their workspace is
												predominantly occupied by shelf machinery. So, when buying a product from Amazon, you are using a system
												of intelligent AI to be able to navigate through the warehouse to a worker who is packing your items. You can
												see an excellent video showing how the robots navigate here (2022). With cheaper products and faster
												delivery times, what else can we see as a change?
											</P>
											<P>As creepy as it sounds, machines will be in the market for house automation or companions. However, starting
												small, the best robot you can find on the market today is called “Roomba”. Roomba is a robot designed to
												vacuum your floor without you needing to be there to control it. It uses AI to map out your room(s) to be more
												able to vacuum your rooms without the assistance of a human; it can also clean itself with the newer models
												and charge on its own. You can set it up to vacuum on certain days or times or, more hilariously, program it yourself using a third-party API unit for python. Roomba is not limited to vacuuming but can mop your floors,
												using all the previously said things. However, it can also clean the water when recharging or cleaning itself
												when needed.
