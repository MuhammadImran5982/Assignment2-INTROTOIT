                                <h4>Louisa</h4>
                                <p>Being the self proclaimed ‘chairperson’ of the group I had a mass of responsibility fall upon my shoulders which I was open to accept. The start of the assignment felt promising and like everyone had a drive to want to work towards our end goal, however this slowly fell off. The meetings where I communicated that I could not be present at were not recorded on my behalf, and the rest of the group lacked communication, effort and engagement. I often found myself sending a mass of messages to both our Teams and Discord page to be met by my previous messages. I however had hope that eventually everyone would come together fairly close to the end and bring their A game. This is exactly what happened for the majority of our members. There was one member whose personal issues I can put aside, having COVID and requiring to move overseas for a brief period. This is because they stayed on top of their work and if they could not do so, they openly communicated to the whole group about why not. The other group members often fell short of even supplying basic work from the last assignment, which made work such as the personality test reflection almost impossible to complete until the last day that it needed to be submitted. Overall, I believe this group has potential and I refused to give up on it. If the group is to stay together for assignment three there would need to be some huge improvements from all of my team members as most of the time I felt like I was completing the ‘group’ assignment alone.
                                </p>
                                <p>Im proud of myself for completing what I have done, completing my tasks in sections, however due to time limits and lack of group contribution I could not make the report exactly how I wanted to, nonetheless I accepted the fact that I could only control the work that I did and leave the rest.</p>

                                <h4>Lachlan</h4>
                                <p>Over the course of our assignment, I believe our group worked well when we needed to put our heads down but across the board could have worked better. Our assignment initially started out slow, with projects for other subjects often taking priority as the start of this assignment clashed with the end of others. Despite this the group generally was able to achieve the early stepping stones for making progress. Throughout the middle of the assignment period our group was met with some challenges whether it be one member getting covid or others missing classes and meetings, such as myself. While going through these middle weeks myself and another team member demonstrated some issues with communication and being present for classes and meetings, while others continued to show up putting their best foot forward. Despite my personal issues during this time, I continued to make progress on the work that had been assigned to me to ensure that I wouldn’t fall behind with the workload, although I failed to communicate this to other members of the team, making them worry about the progress I was making. Coming to our final week the team was mostly able to come back onto the same page, with the efforts of all our team members coming together to create a report and website we can all be proud to show off. Moving to assignment 3 I will make better steps with openly communicating my progress, as well as my availability to the team for meetings.
                                </p>

                                <h4>James</h4>
                                <p>It wasn't that great at the start, simply because we had other arrangements and other projects such as programming, practical databases, user-centred design, work, or other arrangements. Group-wise our commitment wasn't equally shared as others were contributing more effort whilst others were not. However, that was at the beginning; near the end of the project, there was a lot more commitment, more attention to detail, and an excellent workflow with who needed to do what and how. The majority of that came down to the team's meetings and external meetings. However, at this time of writing this personal reflection, one group member has put in nothing apart from their assessment of one thing. I would say myself at the start; I wasn't so involved simply because I had a lot of work from having a job and other more demanding projects at the time. So, in the beginning, I wasn't incredibly involved there as there would be times when I would forget to show up at Microsoft teams meetings; however, I would always try my best to be there. </p>

                                <h4>Marcus</h4>
                                <p>I think for me personally, I started off quite slow as I had a few other assignments due. Throughout the middle bit of the assignment, I feel as though I sort of regained a bit more momentum in coming to meetings and contributing with ideas to the group; however, to the end I slowed once again. In future I must be able to have consistency in contributing to the group as that really wasn’t a strong point this assignment. It was difficult, but I would like to thank everyone who helped me along the way and to say hats off to everyone else, for doing a really good job. </p>

                                <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
                                <p>The RDC group, in summary, were unorganised, to begin with, as some people were unavailable or too busy with other commitments that would leave them unable to show up to meetings. However, as we got closer to the deadline and people didn’t have other assignments that were more predominant with time sensitivity, the group became much more involved and organised.</p>
                                <p>Things that went well in our group were the ability to communicate from long distances. Having covid and being in another country and time zone after, Muhammed always made himself available to the group and showed up to teams meetings even though it was 7:00 am where he was. We communicated well on what needed to be done and what was done from his great location! Other things were delegating what needed to be done, who was doing what, where they were doing that, and who finished what. This achievement was a significant factor in the ability to finish everything that was needed with the assessment and keep workflow relatively calm.
                                </p>
                                <p>We could have improved on organisation towards the start and team members showing up at critical times such as practical classes. In the beginning, people were not doing work to the standard it needed to be to keep workflow calm, so we didn’t cram everything into the last couple of days. We could have improved this by appropriately involving our time towards the beginning and putting deadlines on what needed to be done. Team members at critical times sometimes also wouldn’t show up on practical class days, and some left early. This was a problem since that would leave one or more people to do the work in an environment that needed everyone to show up. We could have improved this by holding people accountable, which we did.
                                </p>
                                <p>Each member did their best towards the end, and each had a surprising thing in which they involved themselves. Muhammed “pulled an all-nighter” making the group's best website as ever seen. Louisa, doing the challenging hours and pulling through right from the beginning doing lots of work and a tremendous amount of organisation including all of the report of the document. Lachlan, always being involved and doing his work. James, finding out what needs to be done and what is finished to find what things are missing. Marcus, looking cool without a wallet.</p>
                                <p>We learned about the group how much commitment is needed once you’re in a group, as things were sometimes time-sensitive.</p>
