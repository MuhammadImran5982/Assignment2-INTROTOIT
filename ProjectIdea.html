									<h2>CarParks Victoria</h2>
								
									<header>
										<h4>OverView of the Application</h4>
										<p>In essence, my project would be a partnership with the Victorian Government's Public Transport Victoria (PTV) Network in Collaboration with their recent ‘Car Parks for Commuters’ Program. It would be to create a car park availability application (App). The application would allow users to find their nearest train station that has the option for car-parking; check the times of greatest and lowest busyness and see if and how many available car spots there are, ahead of time. This would cut-down on travel time for many ‘park-and-ride’ users and would be a completely free platform. </p>
										<h4>Motivation to create the Application</h4>
										<p>I am a first-year university student and I often find myself circling around train station car parks waiting for a car spot to become available. This often adds 20 minutes to half an hour to my travel time, and severely frustrates me. I, and many other commuters, try to take the train into the city because parking in Melbourne’s Central Business District (CBD) can be extremely costly, and sometimes even has one-to-two-hour time constraints. This, for myself and many others, is not helpful as working and studying in the city means needing to be there for hours at a time.
										</p>
										<p>
											Currently on the market, there are many parking applications that suit the needs of those seeking paid parking areas. Making the audience for many of these applications only accessible to those that have the funds to pay for short term parking. Being a student and working part-time means I do not have enough money to be able to afford to pay for parking every day of the week; and I am sure many others who go about their day in the city are in the same boat.
										</p>
										<p>
											Henceforth, I believe having a free application that assists in finding available car spots at train stations would make getting into the city more cost effective and less time consuming.
										</p>
										<h4>Description of the Functionality </h4>
										<p>The Application would be available on all platforms. This would include a website, an app for both Apple™ and Android making the app easily accessible for anyone on any device. The Interface colour palette would match that of the current PTV app; being grey, white and red. However, it would feature a more modernised and simple user interface that appeals to Jakob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics. This would ensure both new and experienced users can easily pick up how to use the app for easy functionality and ease of use.</p>
										<h2>Major Features</h2>
										<h4>Clickable Parking Spot Reservation User Interface (UI): </h4>
										<p>This would give users the ability to enter in a rough time estimate for how long they may be using the parking spot for; this would allow other users to know when spots will become available. Further, the application would prompt notifications to users before and when a spot is about to become available. The interface design would be similar to that of seating on an aeroplane or movie theatre. However, the ‘seats’ would be swapped out for car spots and their car spot number which would be located on the floor of the car park.</p>
										<section>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Project idea2.png" alt="" /></span>This would need to include onsite technology that sensors when a car is in a car spot, called “Vehicle Detection Sensors” (similar to that of a shopping centre). It would also require stations where people can enter in the times that they are going to be parked at the station in a “manual” sense. This may be particularly useful to get more people to add data to the app without physically needing to download it. That data would then get sent to the app and update the app every few minutes.</p>	
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Project idea 1.png" alt="" /></span>A problem that may be face with this is users forgetting or not wanting to enter in this data, however, to fix that issue it could be made mandatory to enter in before touching on a myki, and would even have the option of allowing users to enter in that they are unsure of when they will get back to their car spot.</p>
										</section>
										<h2>Other smaller features (however still important): </h2>
										<h4>Apple or Google Maps Capabilities with Interchangeability:</h4>
										<p>A ‘map’ interface that can be changed based on the user’s preference with pinpoint locations marking the nearest train stations and their car parks. It would be used by allowing the user to pinch and scroll (similarly to how they use any maps app) and would see icons of nearby train stations.</p>
										<p>This would include the ability to show one’s own location; see the address’ of the car parks of their choosing; be redirected to their map app of choice which will then grant them the ability to get directions from their location to the end destination and provide an estimate of how long it will take to get there and the easiest route.</p>
										<h4>Busiest Times Graph:</h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Project Idea 3.png" alt="" /></span>This will show the users the peaks and troughs of the busiest times and when to best arrive at their preferred car park. It would be regularly updated and be based on visits to each location. (Similar to the ‘Popular Times’ Graph curated by Google inc.)</p>	
										<h4>A Menu Bar with easy access to tabs such as a ‘favourite station preference’:</h4>
										<p>A favourites section would allow users to pin their favourite station’s carpark and car spot so they can hastily get updates about the availability of their favourite car spot or location and if it becomes available.</p>
										<p>It would also allow them to easily switch between the maps, the busiest times graph and other features of the app.</p>
										<h4>Car spot reservation option:</h4>
										<p>This would allow users to reserve a spot ahead of time for a small, accessible fee that would be judged based on how long that individual plans to stay in their car spot. This would be helpful to users that attend the train station daily for example work commuters that require a spot daily. They would first choose their end destination (which train station they will be getting of at) and then have the option to choose if they would like to reserve the spot daily, monthly, or yearly; with the system estimating prices based on calculations of how long they would like to reserve the spot and the accessibility of the spot.</p>
										<h2>Tools and Technologies required including software, hardware, open-source material, and other equipment needed:</h2>
										<p>Software required: Programming Systems for both Apple devices (Swift) and android devices (C++, Java, JavaScript, and XML). Software such as Atom or Sublime to edit the code. Mock-up software such as Wireframe to create User-Interface mock-ups. Cloud Services are needed to hold data obtained by the app from users' use. HTML and CSS are required for the creation of a website.</p>
										<p>Hardware required: Physical hard drives are required to keep backups of data in case something happens to cloud services and vice versa. A computer to create and edit code. The possibility of an Apple, Android, and computer device for testing.</p>
										<p>Open-source material: Apple iOS requires a native app called XCode, Android requires Android Studio and is based on Java and XML. Native Script can be used for both iOS and Android.</p>
										<h2>The Skills required to create the Car Parks Victoria app are as follows:</h2>
										<p>• A drive to want to create the app, primarily.</p>
										<p>• Proficiency in a multitude of coding languages such as Python, Java, XML, HTML, CSS as a strong understandability of each coding software as to debug any issues.</p>
										<p>• Creative ability to develop a user interface that is appealing to the eye yet functionable to the highest degree. Thus, an understanding of design skills such as the elements and principles of Design, which are easily researchable and able to be applied to designing. Further, an ability to use a creative media such as Adobe illustrator or photoshop to create the app logo and further designs for within the app such as logos and other design elements on the interface.</p>
										<p>• Becoming proficient in coding requires many years of learning and experience and would need to be completed by a team, rather than one individual alone. Hence, the ability to work well within a team environment is required. Further, using an open source such as Native Script that only requires one to be proficient in JavaScript and may be more helpful for a beginner, such as myself.</p>
										<p>• Hardware such as the car detector sensors would need to be installed at all local train station that have a carpark, and therefore one would be required to learn how to install and use the devices to connect to a network. This network would need a failsafe backup and would also require power.</p>
										<h2>How will this application be Safe and secure? </h2>
										<p>​​Cyber-attacks are common as 1 takes place every 39-seconds. Protecting our application and our user’s data is one of our main priorities. This application will be protected by some simple cybersecurity strategies. One of the strategies is to Check your user-submitted variables for fraudulent inputs that could cause your software to cause crashes. A whitelist - a cybersecurity tactic that provides a set of patterns or criteria that blocks benign inputs. The whitelist method allows users to meet their requirements while blocking anything else. This would be useful in our application as it requires users to add data and share information such as location to find the closest option as requested, so therefore users can only add data which requires keeping the application safe.</p>
										<p>Another Strategy that would be useful to keep our application safe is a single sign-on or multi sign-on authentication. User’s credentials are acquired from a directory or an identity database service. Multi-factor authentication is the ideal cybersecurity measure for making your application more secure.</p>
										<p>Some more simple yet useful feature we can use to keep our application safe and secure is by using a firewall. A Firewall analyses all incoming and outgoing traffic, using set rules it creates a barrier which is used to block viruses and attacks on the application. Information can also be blocked if it is flagged by the Developer. The application must be updated regularly to meet the latest standards to protect it, or it is very likely to get hacked or saved data being stolen. </p>
										<p>A simple way to protect the application would be by using a security software, it is the simplest yet effective way as a lot of work is done by the software and the Security analyst/ developer only needs to implement the software on the application and update it regularly. </p>
										<h2>The outcome and how we hope the app will function if it is successful:</h2>
										<p>If successful, the outcome would be a fully functioning carpark app that would make the lives of daily commuters such as myself a lot easier, faster and more cost effective. It may add an extra step to the lives of those who catch public transport however, overall, it would save hours each week trying to find a carpark, use less fuel, saving them more money in the long run. Eventually, the application would accumulate a variation of different users, and would get smarter with every increment of data accrued. It may also encourage patrons who regularly drive into work to reconsider their: parking expenses and how long it takes them to get into the city and, in turn, the application creation may encourage them to take public transport. Hence, unbeknownst to them, would be helping the environment.</p>
