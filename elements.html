									  <h4>Job description and What made the job appealing to Louisa</h4>
									  <p>The role requires me to manage senior leaders whilst bringing technological “thought” to the team thus, combining business with technology. The core of this role is the embedding of Information Technology business-wide, whilst also aiming to remove the blockades that can come from a lack thereof. Further, project management would mean taking charge of a team, striving them to bring out the best in their abilities to ensure goals and deadlines are met. I was drawn to this role because I believe I was a born leader. The job attracts good pay, and working over a team are positive benefits, however it requires experience from past jobs, and I will not be able to obtain the job overnight. It requires good networking, soft skills, communication and reliability to name a few things. All of these skills I believe I have the basic fundamentals of, however I would love to broaden my skills in all of these areas. Hence, having an end goal which is not strivable straight away excites me and keeps me on track throughout my work and educational career thus far.</p>
									  <h4>Job description and What made the job appealing to Lachlan</h4>
									  <p>For my ideal job I would love to end up being a project lead developer. Being a lead developer, I would be responsible for making and maintaining a team of talented individuals to help create new programs or technological solutions to the problems that we are given from our clients. The main draw that being a lead developer has on me is the ability to work on the technical aspects of a project, alongside working with our client to ensure that we are delivering a product that they are satisfied with. I believe this suits my abilities as someone with great professional communication and presentation skills, but as well as having a drive to be behind exciting and innovating technical achievements.  </p>
									  <h4>Job description and What made the job appealing to Muhammad</h4>
									  <p>My ideal job is working as a cyber security analyst. A Cyber Security Analyst role in their Security Services team is to monitor and assess diverse client IT environments to deliver an ongoing managed cyber security service. Organisations of all sizes are challenged to fully understand cyber security, not to mention having the expertise on-hand to manage cyber security effectively. Analysts on the team leverage Field Effect’s Covalence platform to find and assess anomalies and turn information from the various sensors into insights that the client can digest and act on. The team faces interesting challenges that require a blend of technical expertise with the ability to distil information and communicate effectively. In this role, I can leverage my expertise to directly help a range of clients and grow by being exposed to widely diverse and varied IT infrastructures. Threat hunting is challenging and requires broad knowledge. It can be very rewarding to help organisations defend against cyber-attacks and know that you are making a difference.  </p>
									  <h2>Job description and What made the job appealing to James</h2>
									  <p>I want to be a software engineer because i’ve always been drawn into automation. From different things from games like minecraft or real world applications i always found it incredibly fascinating just to see something work and work well with code. The achievement of making something work and being useful is the best feeling and makes me want to head towards that direction. I especially love coding with real world robotics, I’ve never truly made a program that specifies in that location however I always wanted to do things such as that. My interest started back in 2018 starting in C++ from my first language, then C#, python, Java and lua. My experience also makes me want to continue a role in that industry since I have such a large interest in it.</p>
									  <h2>Job description and What made the job appealing to Marcus</h2>
									  <p>My ideal job is being a front end developer. To define front-end, it is essentially the face of the website or web-app, the part in which users have to interact with while using the application. Therefore, a front-end developer develops the creation of these things, carefully designing the interface so that it is easy for a user to use, is memorable and is efficient to name a few principles of design. This is appealing to me as I enjoy the creative side of programming, I have always been a creative person who likes to push my boundaries while doing things I enjoy. I also like the fact that I can see my progress with every refresh of the page. I am quite the meticulous person, I am very particular with how I like my pages to look: whether that be colour schemes or layouts, and I am excited to one day further this passion in the workforce.</p>
									<h2>Groups required skill set (General and IT related)</h2>
									<p>For our team, we have a relatively even split amongst group members that want to end up working more with the technical aspects of IT as well as working more in the management side of IT. The three members who want to work more in the management side of things are Louisa, Lachie, and Muhammad who want to work as a CIO, Project lead and cyber security analyst respectively. The other two members of our group, James and Marcus, wish to work in more technical aspects with James wanting to work as a software engineer and Marcus wishing to work as a front-end developer. As the IT field is continuously growing, demand for all the jobs that our group members seek to work as increases with every year.
									</p>
									<p>Across the three members who are looking to work in more managerial roles, they all have a clear demand for good communication, which is ranked as the highest in demand skill as of March 2018, as well as a good understanding of the technical elements that they will be working around. Due to all three of these members being responsible for working within and managing teams, their communication skills in addition to the organisation and team management skills must be extremely good, with the ability to clearly relay information to members of their team being pivotal in their role. Additionally, as both Lachie and Muhammad would be working directly with technical aspects of their work their understanding of the necessary components of the technology must be extremely good as to understand the work that is being completed in their teams, in addition to contributing to the technical aspects of their work themselves. While Louisa is required to also have deep knowledge of technologies, her role requires to more broadly know about new technologies that can be implemented into the business that she is working in to further make the goals of the company be reached.
									</p>
									<p>As for the two members who wish to work with the technical aspects of IT, the primary skills that would be required of them would be their deep understanding of the technical tools that they are working with, whether that be a specific programming language they are working with or deep knowledge of other related tools that will help them within their role. As for James wanting to become a software developer, the demand for software engineering skills ranked as 15th out of 25 in March 2018, however the rank of software engineer was 11th out of 25 in the top job titles at the same time. Similarly for Marcus, graphic design skills ranked 10th out of 25, which would be a vital skill in being a front-end developer. While graphic design skills would help Marcus, the need for web developers ranked as 15th for job titles. Both James and Marcus ultimately would need deep understanding of their specific skill sets as to remain competitive within their respective fields

									<h2>Burning Glass (or other) data analysis</h2>
									<h4>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h4>
									<p>As our group looked through the burning glass data, we remain driven to achieve our ideal jobs. However now we have greater insight into how we can achieve these jobs while working on advancing our skill set. This will allow our skills to reflect more accurately on what is required to not only work well in our jobs, but to excel in our fields.

									<h2>Chart 2.1: Technology workersby CIIER occupation groupings, 2018</h2>
									<section>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/industry Data.png" alt="" /></span>This chart indicates that there are a huge number of technological employees across Australia, especially within the ICT management and operations and ICT technical and professional roles, respectively (these being the main two groupings that encompasses the masses of our groups chosen roles.) That being said, the belief that in 2021 there is still a National Shortage (as per Skills Priority List June 2021 - National Skills Commission) means that these jobs are still as demanding as they were two years prior. </p>
