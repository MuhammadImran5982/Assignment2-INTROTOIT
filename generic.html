										<h3>Personality Test Analysis (Pre- Completion)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>As our group, RDC, has five different and unique members, our results for our personality types, learning types, and leadership types are all different. Here’s how we think this impacts our group and working in a team environment. </p>
									<p> Although we have five members of our group, for the ’16 Personalities’ test, our group only had an outcome of three unique personality types. These were the protagonist (ENFJ) held by Louisa, Muhammad, and James, the Mediator (INFP), held by Lachie, and the Debater (ENTP) held by Marcus. With three of our members holding the protagonist personality type, this lends our group to have a strong leadership presence, which works well for the two additional personality types that tend to take a back seat when it comes to leading. This has definitely been displayed within our group, with the three protagonists being consistent with leading group meetings, as well as organising the team and tasks that are to be completed throughout the process of our assignment.</p>
									<h4>A bit about each personality and how it will greatly benefit our group:</h4>
									<h4>ENFJ-A</h4>
									<p>The ENFJ-A personality type suggests that Louisa, James and Muhammad would make up the group leaders and thus would coordinate all the tasks between the group. However, this may create clashes within the group as too similar personalities may lead to each person wanting to get their own way. Nonetheless, it allows for each individual to be in control of a different aspect of the assignment, hence allowing the leadership skills to be evenly distributed and not held solely on one individual’s shoulders.</p>
									<h4>INFP-T</h4>
									<p>The INFP-T personality type displays individuals that may be the group ‘mediator’, thus keeping everyone calm, and collected. However, at the same time, they can be introverted, reserved and quiet, meaning that it is possible for them to lay low and simply do the tasks asked of them. This is an essential asset for the group because it means they will put their heads down and get the work needed to be done to ensure the best possible outcome for the group. They tend to focus more on the big picture rather than the nitty gritty and thus will be able to pull the group leaders back to the task at hand, rather than focusing on all the small little details. Lachies Personality Test result also indicates that he is extremely empathetic and non-judgmental which is vital within a group setting to allow everyone within the group to feel as though they can express their own opinions freely and comfortably.</p>
									<h4>ENTP</h4>
									<p>The ENTP personality type encompasses Marcus. He would be considered the ‘Debater’ of the group</p>
									<p>Furthermore, for our learning styles test, again, 3 out of our 5 members came back with being auditory learners. I believe this to be beneficial to working in a group setting as for us to learn about one aspect of the project someone is unsure about, it promotes discussions and health debate regarding how to complete a task. Generally speaking, this is good within group environments as it promotes communication between group members, thus resulting in clear communication between members and having everyone be on the same page as to where the project is at.</p>
									<p>As for our third tests, our group members varied the tests that were completed. Louisa, Muhammad and Lachie all completed a version of a leadership test. Both Louisa and Muhammad came back being postmodern leaders, leaders who have an emphasis on being bold and creative which is extremely valuable for our group to expand and create our car park solution. Lachie, however, came back with being a Front-Line leader, a leadership style that values empathy and telling stories within their projects. For his third test, James undertook a creativity test, coming back with a result of 51 points, labelling him as being ‘above average’ when it comes to creativity. This will prove invaluable when we move to creating the User Interface for our application, but is also already being shown with his contributions to creating the design layout for our assignment 2 website.</p>
									<h3>Personality Test Analysis (Post- Completion)</h3>
									<p>Reflecting on the completion of our assignment, we found that the defined “leaders” (Louisa James and Muhammad) from the 16 personalities test was extremely accurate. Mostly for Louisa who took charge of the group, assigning herself with the task of creating the teams page, distributing tasks to be done with deadlines that rarely were met and then continually questioning and pushing her team members to contribute. Towards the end of the assignment, James and Muhammad stepped up completely, offering support and also taking charge, controlling the development of the website, which impressed the group entirely, amongst other things. Muhmammad, contributing from a completely different time zone, however still trudged through his work to ensure he did not let the group down. These three continued to support each other, bouncing ideas off one another and showing mass support to the rest of the group.</p>
									<p>Lachie showed some support towards the group, and mainly did his work silently, having presented a majority of it at one of our last few meetings, showing his ability to put his head down, much like his personality test stated.</p>
								<p>James, Lachlan and Louisa displayed their “auditory” learners skills throughout the meetings, by being able to assist other members and each other to better understand the brief asked of them. Louisa having done her interview over a team meeting was better able to understand her interviewee and his relation to the IT industry, through the use of her auditory learning ability.</p>
